# nedb-viewer
View NeDB databases and test find's, somewhat similar to how you can view DynamoDB data in AWS.

Select a folder that contains NeDB databases.  Click a file to view its contents, using the "find" (in NeDB syntax) that you enter.

The items in the database are displayed in a grid.  You can drag each column width as you desire.

Double-click in a row to see the data for that row in a separate window.
